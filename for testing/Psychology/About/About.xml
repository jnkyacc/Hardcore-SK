	<description>This mod expands the social and mood system by adding new traits, interactions, and thoughts. The stories that emerge from your pawns' quirks are the most fun part of RimWorld, and this mod aims to expand on that emergent storytelling by increasing variety.
	
Does not require a new save game.

&lt;b&gt;New Traits&lt;/b&gt;  
- Prude: This old-fashioned pawn hates the sight of nudity, and is mortified by the thought that others might be able to see their private areas. They are eternally disapproving of nudists and bothered by wearing ratty clothing.
- Insomniac: This pawn has a sleeping disorder. They will rarely attempt to sleep, and will never be fully satisfied by doing so. They spend most of their time awake, and thus, productive; but almost always tired.
- Bleeding Heart: This pawn is a big old softie. They will be pleased by doing things that help others, and more traumatized by brutal or senseless acts like mistreatment of prisoners or killing. They also will not get along with psychopaths.
- Picky Eater: This demanding pawn expects to eat well every day. They'll be more satisfied by doing so, but more annoyed by having to eat things other than what they want.
- Bipolar: This unstable pawn experiences random mood swings multiple times a day, and to a greater degree than other pawns, with manic and depressive episodes.
- Anxiety: This pawn is in a perpetually fragile mental state. They are slightly more likely to have a mental break, and occasionally experience panic attacks.
- Lecher: This seedy pawn hits on everyone in sight. Flirting is just second nature to them, regardless of how they feel about another pawn. They will still be bothered by rejection, however.
- Codependent: This pawn needs the comfort of intimacy. They will be unhappy when alone, and devastated by breakups and affairs. On the plus side, they are loyal.
- Bisexual: This pawn is attracted to any gender. They don't discriminate when it comes to love. (idea credit Killface)
- Outdoorsy: This pawn enjoys spending time in the open. They get a mood boost when there's no roof above their head.
- Pluviophile: This pawn simply likes the sound and feel of rain, and will receive a mood bonus from it.
- Photosensitive: This pawn, either through gene modding or random mutation, has eyes that are extremely sensitive to the light. They will be very unhappy at being exposed to it.
- Party Animal: This fun-loving pawn is great at parties, and so your colony will hold them more often as long as they're around.
- Desensitized: This numbed pawn no longer gets mood penalties for witnessing death or observing corpses. They will still be upset by colonists' deaths in general, and by other moral outrages. This trait can potentially be gained during play whenever a pawn sees someone die or looks at a body.

&lt;b&gt;New Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;  
- Adrenaline Rush: Pawns get a short mood boost when killing a hostile from an enemy faction. This gives them some relief at having defended their home.
- Dreams: Pawns may have dreams while sleeping which can affect their mood.
- Passionate Work: Pawns will be a little happier while doing something they have a burning passion for. (idea credit ({x}) Disarray)

&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/b&gt;  
All pawns are slightly less bothered by empathy in general as a middle ground between psychopaths and bleeding hearts.

&lt;b&gt;COMPATIBILITY&lt;/b&gt;  
Psychology detours a lot of methods from the base game. It is probably incompatible with any other mod that overwrites existing traits, affects pawn interactions, overwrites how the game handles medicine rather than just adding new features (e.g. EPOE is compatible), overwrites existing thoughts, or uses code to add new ones. It may be incompatible with any other mod that includes an assembly and uses detours. If Psychology is incompatible with a given mod, some functions of one mod or the other will not work, depending on your mod order. Any missing or broken functionality you experience may be the result of this. To prioritize Psychology trait and thought functionality above other mods', put it at the bottom of your mod list.
