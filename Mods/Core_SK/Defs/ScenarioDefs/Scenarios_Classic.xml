The few slavers that survived the explosion tried to flee in the escape pods, but a failure emergency systems lead to automatic pre-release of those pods. Scattered ship parts crashed onto the planet's surface, killing everyone who was awake inside.\n\n     Nevertheless, some of the slaves sleeping in the prisoner cryptosleep caskets managed to survive the impact and awoke from their slumber.
