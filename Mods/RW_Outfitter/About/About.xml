	<description>Allows pawns to factor in all kinds of gear stat offsets other than just armor.
   - Defaults to sensible priorities based on work types assigned and map seasonal temperatures.
   - Allows you to finetune, add and/or remove priorities.
   - Takes personal traits like temperature preference or mental states into account.
   - No naked pawns!
