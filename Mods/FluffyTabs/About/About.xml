	<description>&lt;size=36&gt;REQUIRES CCL&lt;/size&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;  	
Provides a vastly more customizable work tab.

&lt;b&gt;Features&lt;/b&gt;  	
Various usability extentions to the 'vanilla' work tab; sorting by columns, toggling/changing priorities for entire columns at once, and creating presets.

An extra detailed 'Dwarf Therapist' mode, that allows you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each job.

Finally, a time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allows you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc.

&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;  	
With great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it's a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so use the detailed tab at your own risk!

Finally, there will never be an 'autolabor' mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a 'bulletin board' of jobs that need doing), it's not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special excpetion coding.
